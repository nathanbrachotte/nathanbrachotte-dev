He's an excellent communicator with a good grasp of best software practices. Nathan's positive attitude and dedication to team culture also made him a valuable asset to our team.",

      "I had a chance to work with Nathan for about half a year. Nathan is a great colleague to work with. He has awesome skills in web and for me there were plenty of things to learn from him, especially in organizing ideas and brainstorming them. In addition, it's easy and it's fun to work with him, which I believe is very important too. I would not hesitate to hire him if you want to build a team with healthy relationships in it and build an exceptional product.",

This is also reflected on his behavior as a team member, where he was always very active discussing and proposing solutions and engaging other engineers and designers with the goal of providing the best possible experience for the users.',

      'Nathan was the first hire I made when I took over the software team at colorfy and I got the chance to work with him starting from an internship in February of 2018. At the time he was joining a small team of 3 developers and took over a challenging and important IoT project as a React Native developer. His deep care and feeling of responsibility for his work paired with him being an excellent team player enabled him to deliver critical contributions right from the start. In the end of 2018 he finished his studies of Software and System Engineering with High Honours and became an even more important member of the team in his new role of a full time React Native developer. Nathan is a quick learner and during the growth of the team to 7 members right now he never stopped being vocal about his ideas on processes and more importantly was also candid when we were deriving from our standards. It was a pleasure being a part of his development from an intern to an intermediate developer. Nathan is constantly learning new technologies and frameworks within the React Native world but is also working on other technologies in his spare time which shows his commitment to software development in general.',

He always made sure to share his experience with me and guide me in the right direction. Working with him was a huge learning experience, he was a great part of my professional growth. At such a young age, he's already a great mentor. I am very thankful that I got the chance to work closely with him.",

      "Nathan is one of the most dedicated and driven professionals I have worked with. He will always go that extra mile to look after and deliver for his clients whilst spending as much time in the office as he needs to finish the job and meet his targets. He is always a very good communicator, also when the pressure is rising, calling for clear communication about goals, responsibility, performance, expectations and feedback for every member involved in the project heâ€™s managing. No matter how tense a meeting, Nathan made sure everyone left with a smile. I couldn't recommend Nathan any higher in a professional environment and consider him to be top of my value add list.",
