He always demonstrated a significant ability to think about the entire user journey beyond the "happy path", proposing solutions and ensuring that the end user experience will always be consistent and optimal. This is also reflected on his behavior as a team member, where he was always very active discussing and proposing solutions and engaging other engineers and designers with the goal of providing the best possible experience for the users.',

      'Nathan was the first hire I made when I took over the software team at colorfy and I got the chance to work with him starting from an internship in February of 2018. At the time he was joining a small team of 3 developers and took over a challenging and important IoT project as a React Native developer. His deep care and feeling of responsibility for his work paired with him being an excellent team player enabled him to deliver critical contributions right from the start.',

He always made sure to share his experience with me and guide me in the right direction. Working with him was a huge learning experience, he was a great part of my professional growth.

      "Nathan is one of the most dedicated and driven professionals I have worked with. He will always go that extra mile to look after and deliver for his clients whilst spending as much time in the office as he needs to finish the job and meet his targets. He is always a very good communicator, also when the pressure is rising, calling for clear communication about goals, responsibility, performance, expectations and feedback for every member involved in the project heâ€™s managing. No matter how tense a meeting, Nathan made sure everyone left with a smile. I couldn't recommend Nathan any higher in a professional environment and consider him to be top of my value add list.",
